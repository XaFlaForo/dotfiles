# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles. This repo is used for setting up my personal development environment for my Macbook when I use it. I mainly use windows for client and linux for server

I took these files from adityarpillai GitHub as they were premade and I can adapt them to my needs when needed. So thanks adityarpillai
